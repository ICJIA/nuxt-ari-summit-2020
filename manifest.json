Workshop attendees will learn from industry leaders the benefits and the necessities of being able to seamlessly and effectively connect to virtual platforms for behavioral health services that have traditionally been provided in an “in person” setting. Data on effectiveness, rules and regulations that create opportunities and barriers, as well as examples of virtual platform resources will be shared with workshop attendees.\n\n- Debbie Humphrey, MBA, BSN, RN, Executive Director, Madison County Mental Health Board\n\n- Kristine Gamm-Smith, Executive Director, NAMI of Southern Illinois\n\n- James Wallis, Director of Business Development, Chestnut Health Systems\n\n[Recording: https://youtu.be/eXTTZqR0pvU](https://youtu.be/eXTTZqR0pvU)\n\n[Slides: 21st Century Treatment - The Dance of Transforming Traditional to Virtual Services](Slides-21stCenturyTreatment-TheDanceofTransformingTraditionaltoVirtualServices.pdf)\n\n### Aligning Community-Based Housing Responses with Community Corrections Initiatives\n\nThe goals of the Adult Redeploy Illinois program to keep people in their community, out of prison and jail, while increasing health and employment are aligned with the goals of other community-based services such as supportive housing. CSH will discuss the findings of the planning project in partnership with ICJIA, highlight local and national evidence on how housing interventions reduce justice involvement, and uplift statewide opportunities to increase access to housing resources for this population. This session will also include concrete next steps within each community, uplifting steps already being taken among ARI sites.\n\n- Betsy Benito, Director for Illinois Programs, Corporation for Supportive Housing  \n  Richard Rowe, Senior Program Manager, Corporation for Supportive Housing\n\n[Recording: https://youtu.be/ILoVZ0LtfcY](https://youtu.be/ILoVZ0LtfcY)\n\n[Slides: Aligning Community-Based Housing Responses with Community Corrections Initiatives](https://archive.icjia-api.cloud/files/adult-redeploy/2020%20Summit%20Materials/Slides-CSH-Aligning%20Community-Based%20Housing%20ResponseswCommunityCorrectionsInitiatives.pdf)\n\n[Resource: A Continuum of Supports for Housing the Justice-Involved](AContinuumOfSupportsForHousingTheJustice-Involved.pdf)\n\n[Resource: Just Housing Initiative Fact Sheet 2019](JustHousingInitiativeFactSheet2019.pdf)\n\n[Resource: Issue Brief - Addressing Housing Instability – NGA CSH](NGA-CSH-IssueBrief-AddressingHousingInstability.pdf)\n\n<!-- TAGS: Reintegration Resources -->\n\n### Breakthroughs in Trauma Treatment\n\nEffectively addressing trauma is vital to the success of ARI participants and programs.

They reach a point of using jail as a sanction. We know that jail destabilizes people; even one to three days may cause loss of employment, housing, child custody, or family ties. Jail can traumatize people, and in these days of COVID-19, it may be an unintended death sentence. Violations often occur because of past or present trauma in the lives of the participants we serve. How might a restorative justice approach help reduce violations or bad decision-making that may be caused by trauma? What level of personal freedom is necessary to effectively promote lawful behavior? What tools might officers need in order to achieve the outcomes they strive for that relate to safety and accountability, pro-social functioning, and community integration?\n\n- Fred Cooper, Restorative Justice Coordinator, Illinois Balance and Restorative Justice\n\n- Avik Das, Director and Chief Probation Officer, Cook County Juvenile Probation and Court Services\n\n- Mike Douglas, Director, DeKalb County Treatment Courts\n\n- Nancy Michaels, Interim Co-Executive Director, Illinois Balanced and Restorative Justice\n\n[Recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eTFPc47vXw&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eTFPc47vXw&feature=youtu.be)\n\n[Resource: 5 Rs of Restorative Practice](5-RsOfRestorativePractice.pdf)\n\n[Resource: 7 Core Assumptions - Circle Forward](7CoreAssumptions-CircleForward.pdf)\n\n[Resource: Peacemaking Circles](PeacemakingCircles.pdf)\n\n[Resource: Using Restorative Practices for Community Building – Kay Pranis](Pranis-UsingRestorativePracticesForCommunityBuilding.pdf)\n\n[Resource: Restorative Justice Grounding Principles Framework](RestorativeJusticeGroundingPrinciplesFramework.pdf)\n\n[Resource: Restorative Justice on the Rise - Individual & Collective Accountability – Kay Pranis](Pranis-RestorativeJusticeOnTheRise-Individual&CollectiveAccountability.pdf)\n\n<!-- TAGS: Effective and Restorative Practices -->\n\n### Neurobiology of Substance Use Disorders & Medication Assisted Treatment\n\nSubstance Use Disorder is a chronic, relapsing brain disease.

Positive test results can lead to probation sanctions, technical violations, and revocations, which, for some, may result in a period of incarceration. There is currently a lack of guidance for probation departments on drug testing, as well as a limited research on drug testing’s impact on reducing recidivism or improving behavioral health. This presentation will review existing information on drug testing offering information on efficacy, best practices, and limitations. The presentation will also share findings from a recent ICJIA study of Illinois probation departments which offers information on the landscape of probation policies and procedures and drug testing administration. Finally, the presentation features a discussion on drug testing in the age of COVID-19.\n\n- Jessica Reichert, Acting Associate Director, Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority\n\n- Emily Behnke, Deputy Court Administrator, Problem-Solving Courts, 17th Judicial Circuit\n\n[Recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suoDEIMq8JA&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suoDEIMq8JA&feature=youtu.be)\n\n[Slides: Transforming Day-to-Day Probation Practice - The Use of Drug Testing – Jessica Reichert](Slides-TransformingDay-to-DayProbationPractice-TheUseofDrugTesting,Reichert.pdf)\n\n[Slides: The Use of Drug Testing in a Problem-Solving Court – Emily Behnke](https://archive.icjia-api.cloud/files/adult-redeploy/2020%20Summit%20Materials/Slides-The%20Use%20of%20Drug%20Testing%20in%20a%20Problem-Solving%20Court,%20Behnke.pdf)\n\n<!-- TAGS: Drug Court -->\n\n### Using Evaluation to Advance Best Practices in Drug Court Programs\n\nThis session is designed to help agencies utilize data to advance best practices in their drug court programs.

Workshop attendees will learn from industry leaders the benefits and the necessities of being able to seamlessly and effectively connect to virtual platforms for behavioral health services that have traditionally been provided in an “in person” setting. Data on effectiveness, rules and regulations that create opportunities and barriers, as well as examples of virtual platform resources will be shared with workshop attendees.</p><ul><li><p>Debbie Humphrey, MBA, BSN, RN, Executive Director, Madison County Mental Health Board</p></li><li><p>Kristine Gamm-Smith, Executive Director, NAMI of Southern Illinois</p></li><li><p>James Wallis, Director of Business Development, Chestnut Health Systems</p></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/eXTTZqR0pvU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Recording: https://youtu.be/eXTTZqR0pvU</a></p><p><a href=\"Slides-21stCenturyTreatment-TheDanceofTransformingTraditionaltoVirtualServices.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Slides: 21st Century Treatment - The Dance of Transforming Traditional to Virtual Services</a></p><h3 id=\"aligning-community-based-housing-responses-with-community-corrections-initiatives\">Aligning Community-Based Housing Responses with Community Corrections Initiatives</h3><p>The goals of the Adult Redeploy Illinois program to keep people in their community, out of prison and jail, while increasing health and employment are aligned with the goals of other community-based services such as supportive housing. CSH will discuss the findings of the planning project in partnership with ICJIA, highlight local and national evidence on how housing interventions reduce justice involvement, and uplift statewide opportunities to increase access to housing resources for this population.

They reach a point of using jail as a sanction. We know that jail destabilizes people; even one to three days may cause loss of employment, housing, child custody, or family ties. Jail can traumatize people, and in these days of COVID-19, it may be an unintended death sentence. Violations often occur because of past or present trauma in the lives of the participants we serve. How might a restorative justice approach help reduce violations or bad decision-making that may be caused by trauma? What level of personal freedom is necessary to effectively promote lawful behavior?

Positive test results can lead to probation sanctions, technical violations, and revocations, which, for some, may result in a period of incarceration. There is currently a lack of guidance for probation departments on drug testing, as well as a limited research on drug testing’s impact on reducing recidivism or improving behavioral health. This presentation will review existing information on drug testing offering information on efficacy, best practices, and limitations. The presentation will also share findings from a recent ICJIA study of Illinois probation departments which offers information on the landscape of probation policies and procedures and drug testing administration.
