The COVID-19 era offers a rare opportunity for individual and system reflection. This experience challenges all of us, but our clients struggle with uncertainty even in times of stable health. Now is a good time to reinforce ARI’s core tenet that local communities are invested in improving the condition of individuals in their midst who are at risk and in need.
