The session will cover exciting research on the neurobiology of vicarious trauma as well as talk about stress and compassion fatigue. Participants will walk away with practical tools to build resilience and buffer yourself from vicarious trauma. You will learn strategies that you can use in-the-moment, while working with clients, to set your brain up for success. We will learn how to not play the pass-the-trauma game with colleagues and how to engage in boundaried empathy. You will leave this training with an understanding of your risk for vicarious trauma, a self-care plan, resilience strategies, and tips to manage the impact from your exposure to traumatizing information.\n\n- Anjali Nandi, Ph.D., LAC, MAC, Director, InStil Consulting\n\nhttps://youtu.be/oRDJmb1qnUI\n\n[Slides: Wellness Strategies to Build Resilience – Dr. Anjali Nandi ](S:\\MARY ANN DYAR\\Adult Redeploy Illinois\\All-Sites Summit\\June 2020 All-Sites Summit\\Presentations\\Power Points\\Day 2\\WellnessStrategies-ANandi.pdf)\n\n\n## Breakout Sessions\n\n21st Century Treatment: The Dance of Transforming Traditional to Virtual Services  \nWhether we are in unprecedented times of a pandemic, or a person merely lives in a rural or urban area without reliable transportation, “Access to Care” is a real issue facing many individuals seeking care, as well as those referring individuals for services. Workshop attendees will learn from industry leaders the benefits and the necessities of being able to seamlessly and effectively connect to virtual platforms for behavioral health services that have traditionally been provided in an “in person” setting. Data on effectiveness, rules and regulations that create opportunities and barriers, as well as examples of virtual platform resources will be shared with workshop attendees.\n\n- Debbie Humphrey, MBA, BSN, RN, Executive Director, Madison County Mental Health Board\n\n- Kristine Gamm-Smith, Executive Director, NAMI of Southern Illinois \n\n- James Wallis, Director of Business Development, Chestnut Health Systems \n\nhttps://youtu.be/eXTTZqR0pvU \n\n[Slides: 21st Century Treatment - The Dance of Transforming Traditional to Virtual Services](S:\\MARY ANN DYAR\\Adult Redeploy Illinois\\All-Sites Summit\\June 2020 All-Sites Summit\\Presentations\\Power Points\\Day 1\\21stCenturyTreatment-TheDanceOfTransformingTraditionalToVirtualServices.pdf)\n\n<!-- TAGS: Mental Health Court -->\n\n\n### Aligning Community-Based Housing Responses with Community Corrections Initiatives\n\nThe goals of the Adult Redeploy Illinois program to keep people in their community, out of prison and jail, while increasing health and employment are aligned with the goals of other community-based services such as supportive housing.  CSH will discuss the findings of the planning project in partnership with ICJIA, highlight local and national evidence on how housing interventions reduce justice involvement, and uplift statewide opportunities to increase access to housing resources for this population.

They reach a point of using jail as a sanction. We know that jail destabilizes people; even one to three days may cause loss of employment, housing, child custody, or family ties. Jail can traumatize people, and in these days of COVID-19, it may be an unintended death sentence. Violations often occur because of past or present trauma in the lives of the participants we serve. How might a restorative justice approach help reduce violations or bad decision-making that may be caused by trauma? What level of personal freedom is necessary to effectively promote lawful behavior? What tools might officers need in order to achieve the outcomes they strive for that relate to safety and accountability, pro-social functioning, and community integration?\n\n- Fred Cooper, Restorative Justice Coordinator, Illinois Balance and Restorative Justice\n\n- Avik Das, Director and Chief Probation Officer, Cook County Juvenile Probation and Court Services\n\n- Mike Douglas, Director, DeKalb County Treatment Courts\n\n- Nancy Michaels, Interim Co-Executive Director, Illinois Balanced and Restorative Justice\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eTFPc47vXw&feature=youtu.be\n\n[Resource: 5 Rs of Restorative Practice](S:\\MARY ANN DYAR\\Adult Redeploy Illinois\\All-Sites Summit\\June 2020 All-Sites Summit\\Summit Materials\\Summit Materials\\5-RsOfRestorativePractice.pdf)\n\n[Resource: 7 Core Assumptions - Circle Forward](S:\\MARY ANN DYAR\\Adult Redeploy Illinois\\All-Sites Summit\\June 2020 All-Sites Summit\\Summit Materials\\Summit Materials\\7CoreAssumptions-CircleForward.pdf)\n\n[Resource: Peacemaking Circles](S:\\MARY ANN DYAR\\Adult Redeploy Illinois\\All-Sites Summit\\June 2020 All-Sites Summit\\Summit Materials\\Summit Materials\\PeacemakingCircles.pdf)\n\n[Resource: Using Restorative Practices for Community Building – Kay Pranis](S:\\MARY ANN DYAR\\Adult Redeploy Illinois\\All-Sites Summit\\June 2020 All-Sites Summit\\Summit Materials\\Summit Materials\\Pranis-UsingRestorativePracticesForCommunityBuilding.pdf)\n\n[Resource: Restorative Justice Grounding Principles Framework](S:\\MARY ANN DYAR\\Adult Redeploy Illinois\\All-Sites Summit\\June 2020 All-Sites Summit\\Summit Materials\\Summit Materials\\RestorativeJusticeGroundingPrinciplesFramework.pdf)\n\n[Resource: Restorative Justice on the Rise - Individual & Collective Accountability – Kay Pranis](S:\\MARY ANN DYAR\\Adult Redeploy Illinois\\All-Sites Summit\\June 2020 All-Sites Summit\\Summit Materials\\Summit Materials\\Pranis-RestorativeJusticeOnTheRise-Individual&CollectiveAccountability.pdf)\n\n<!-- TAGS: Effective and Restorative Practices -->\n\n\n### Neurobiology of Substance Use Disorders & Medication Assisted Treatment\n\nSubstance Use Disorder is a chronic, relapsing brain disease.

Positive test results can lead to probation sanctions, technical violations, and revocations, which, for some, may result in a period of incarceration. There is currently a lack of guidance for probation departments on drug testing, as well as a limited research on drug testing’s impact on reducing recidivism or improving behavioral health. This presentation will review existing information on drug testing offering information on efficacy, best practices, and limitations. The presentation will also share findings from a recent ICJIA study of Illinois probation departments which offers information on the landscape of probation policies and procedures and drug testing administration.

Jail can traumatize people, and in these days of COVID-19, it may be an unintended death sentence. Violations often occur because of past or present trauma in the lives of the participants we serve. How might a restorative justice approach help reduce violations or bad decision-making that may be caused by trauma?
