Adult Redeploy Illinois (ARI) is a state grant program supporting local efforts to divert individuals from prison to more effective and less expensive community-based supervision and services. ARI is administered by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority.

ARI sites use grant funds to design and implement programs that address individualsâ€™ risks and needs and leverage their strengths and assets (family support, employment) to improve public safety and personal outcomes. ARI has grown from five initial pilot sites in early 2011, to the current 25 sites implementing about 50 programs covering 44 Illinois counties (as of June 2020).{.mb-5}
