Adult Redeploy Illinois is a state grant program supporting local efforts to divert individuals from prison to more effective and less expensive community-based supervision and services.

ARI sites use grant funds to design and implement programs that address individualsâ€™ risks and needs and leverage their assets (family support, employment) to improve public safety and personal outcomes. ARI has grown from five initial pilot sites in early 2011, to the current 26 sites implementing about 50 programs covering 42 Illinois counties (as of March 2019).{.mb-5}
