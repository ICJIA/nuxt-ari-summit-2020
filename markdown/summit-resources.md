### Wellness Strategies to Build Resilience

This workshop is an empowering twist on vicarious trauma. The session will cover exciting research on the neurobiology of vicarious trauma as well as talk about stress and compassion fatigue. Participants will walk away with practical tools to build resilience and buffer yourself from vicarious trauma. You will learn strategies that you can use in-the-moment, while working with clients, to set your brain up for success. We will learn how to not play the pass-the-trauma game with colleagues and how to engage in boundaried empathy. You will leave this training with an understanding of your risk for vicarious trauma, a self-care plan, resilience strategies, and tips to manage the impact from your exposure to traumatizing information.

## Breakout Sessions

<div style="margin-left: 20px">

### 21st Century Treatment: The Dance of Transforming Traditional to Virtual Services  

Whether we are in unprecedented times of a pandemic, or a person merely lives in a rural or urban area without reliable transportation, “Access to Care” is a real issue facing many individuals seeking care, as well as those referring individuals for services. Workshop attendees will learn from industry leaders the benefits and the necessities of being able to seamlessly and effectively connect to virtual platforms for behavioral health services that have traditionally been provided in an “in person” setting. Data on effectiveness, rules and regulations that create opportunities and barriers, as well as examples of virtual platform resources will be shared with workshop attendees.

### Aligning Community-Based Housing Responses with Community Corrections Initiatives

The goals of the Adult Redeploy Illinois program to keep people in their community, out of prison and jail, while increasing health and employment are aligned with the goals of other community-based services such as supportive housing.  CSH will discuss the findings of the planning project in partnership with ICJIA, highlight local and national evidence on how housing interventions reduce justice involvement, and uplift statewide opportunities to increase access to housing resources for this population. This session will also include concrete next steps within each community, uplifting steps already being taken among ARI sites.

### Breakthroughs in Trauma Treatment

Effectively addressing trauma is vital to the success of ARI participants and programs. This session explains elements of a basic Integrated Trauma Treatment Program (ITTP) including psychotherapy types used (EMDR, Seeking Safety, and others), effective practices, and systemic aspects. We will discuss funding mechanisms, and how to build and maintain partnerships across legal, medical, and social service sectors.

### Community Engagement & Restorative Practices in ARI

How can Adult Redeploy Illinois sites integrate restorative practices into their programs? We will discuss the four pillars of restorative practice and how they make a difference, how restorative practices can be used in different types of ARI programs, and how the Macon County Community Restorative Board connects participants with community members who bring resources and opportunities beyond what ARI alone can offer.

### Effective Sanctions & Restorative Community Practice

Probation officers and courts sometimes face repeated non-compliance by people they supervise. They reach a point of using jail as a sanction. We know that jail destabilizes people; even one to three days may cause loss of employment, housing, child custody, or family ties. Jail can traumatize people, and in these days of COVID-19, it may be an unintended death sentence. Violations often occur because of past or present trauma in the lives of the participants we serve. How might a restorative justice approach help reduce violations or bad decision-making that may be caused by trauma? What level of personal freedom is necessary to effectively promote lawful behavior? What tools might officers need in order to achieve the outcomes they strive for that relate to safety and accountability, pro-social functioning, and community integration?

### Neurobiology of Substance Use Disorders & Medication Assisted Treatment

Substance Use Disorder is a chronic, relapsing brain disease. This complex disease takes more than a strong will to quit. Understanding how the brain functions helps us to use appropriate strategies that impact program retention. We explore key components in chemical dependence, how addictive substances affect the brain, evidence-based practices for substance use disorder, and the role of MAT in treatment.

### Prison Use Declines in ARI Jurisdictions - Implications for the Future

One of the baseline questions about alternatives to incarceration is whether they impact the use of prison.  Last year SPAC analyzed criminal justice data to answer the question: "Does Adult Redeploy Illinois change the rate of prison use in jurisdictions with ARI programs?" The SPAC team will present what the analysis revealed and offer their thoughts on what the results mean for ARI.

### Records Relief: Why & How

How can judges, prosecutors, and defense counsel prevent criminal convictions from shattering lives and exacerbating recidivism? What has the impact of records relief been for ARI graduates? What are the myths and facts about collateral consequences of felony convictions? What are the barriers to public benefits, housing, employment, and financial aid? How can ARI court programs reduce harm for their participants and engage in criminal records relief? How do expungement and sealing of records work? Last of all, how can the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act aid participants?

### Transforming Day-to-Day Probation Practice: The Use of Drug Testing

Individuals on probation often are subject to drug testing. Positive test results can lead to probation sanctions, technical violations, and revocations, which, for some, may result in a period of incarceration. There is currently a lack of guidance for probation departments on drug testing, as well as a limited research on drug testing’s impact on reducing recidivism or improving behavioral health. This presentation will review existing information on drug testing offering information on efficacy, best practices, and limitations. The presentation will also share findings from a recent ICJIA study of Illinois probation departments which offers information on the landscape of probation policies and procedures and drug testing administration. Finally, the presentation features a discussion on drug testing in the age of COVID-19.

### Using Evaluation to Advance Best Practices in Drug Court Programs

This session is designed to help agencies utilize data to advance best practices in their drug court programs. During this presentation we will explore different ways to generate data on your program’s service population, service delivery, and program outcomes. We also discuss how to utilize data to (a) celebrate program accomplishments, (b) identify areas for improvement, and (c) inform program decisions.

Why Day Programming is More Than STATS: The Importance of Staying Connected during a Pandemic  
Day programming can be used as a therapeutic adjustment tool, and also as a way to keep participants connected during uncertain times.

This workshop will take a deeper look into how day programming has assisted the Will County Problem Solving Court participants during COVID-19.

### Working with Emerging Adults

This session explores the growing movement for criminal justice practitioners to recognize and adapt to the unique needs and strengths of emerging adults.  The panelists discuss the developmental characteristics of young adults and how those affect justice-system interactions, the supports and structures emerging adults need to be safe and successful, and what that means for the work of justice system stakeholders.
