The 2020 Adult Redeploy Illinois All-Sites Summit: Ten Years of Transformation was held virtually June 17-18, 2020.

Hosted by Adult Redeploy Illinois (ARI) and the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, the Summit marked the tenth anniversary of ARI and brought together multi-disciplinary team members from counties and judicial circuits operating ARI-funded local prison diversion programs.

The Summit was presented on the Webex platform and used the Whova app for registration and ways to interact before, during, and after the Summit. The agenda included plenary sessions and workshops designed to spark conversations to take ARI's work to the next level, and to honor the hard work partners are undertaking. There were inspiring keynote speakers, vital plenary sessions, and some MCLE and CEUs available.

ARI’s work is rooted in the intrinsic value of the people we work with and their ability to do better. The COVID-19 era offers a rare opportunity for individual and system reflection. This experience challenges all of us, but our clients struggle with uncertainty even in times of stable health. Now is a good time to reinforce ARI’s core tenet that local communities are invested in improving the condition of individuals in their midst who are at risk and in need. It is an opportunity for us to show our clients and system stakeholders that we are more than agents of enforcement and that our relationships have an impact.

This conference is an investment in our diverse team members and the important role they play in motivating transformation. We will explore what it will mean to gain a deeper understanding of restorative practices and implement less traditional, more effective ways of facilitating individual and systemic transformation. How will a deeper knowledge of what safe communities need transform us? ARI is strengths-based, values-informed, locally designed and controlled transformation.
