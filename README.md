> The 2019 Adult Redeploy Illinois & Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils Summit

Hosted by Adult Redeploy Illinois, the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, and Loyola Universityâ€™s Center for Criminal Justice Research, Policy, and Practice, the Summit will bring together multi-disciplinary team members from counties and judicial circuits operating or interested in developing CJCCs and ARI-funded local prison diversion programs. Serving as both the eighth annual ARI All-Sites Summit and the third convening of CJCCs from around the state, the event will provide rich opportunities for mutual learning and foster coordinated decision-making.
