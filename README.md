> The 2020 Adult Redeploy Illinois & Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils Summit

The 2020 Adult Redeploy Summit was presented on the Webex platform and used the Whova app for registration and ways to interact before, during, and after the Summit. The agenda included plenary sessions and workshops designed to spark conversations to take ARI's work to the next level, and to honor the hard work partners are undertaking. There were inspiring keynote speakers, vital plenary sessions, and some MCLE and CEUs available.  

Adult Redeploy Illinois (ARI) is a state grant program supporting local efforts to divert individuals from prison to more effective and less expensive community-based supervision and services. ARI is administered by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority.

ARI sites use grant funds to design and implement programs that address individualsâ€™ risks and needs and leverage their strengths and assets (family support, employment) to improve public safety and personal outcomes. ARI has grown from five initial pilot sites in early 2011, to the current 25 sites implementing about 50 programs covering 44 Illinois counties (as of June 2020).
